BackboneQuizRequireJs
=====================

This quiz app was built with:

HTML

CSS

Javascript

jQuery

Ajax: for loading all quiz questions from package.json

Backbone.js: for more organized code

RequireJS: to define modules and to load scripts

RequireJS text plugin: to load text templates

Twitter Bootstrap: for cleaner styling and changing the nav bar if window width is decreased

I also took advantage of cookies and the localStorage object to remember the user if the page is reloaded or if the user revisits the page another time.
