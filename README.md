BackboneQuizRequireJs
=====================

This quiz app was built with:

<li>HTML.

CSS.

Javascript.

jQuery.

Backbone.js.

RequireJS: to define modules and load scripts.

RequireJS text plugin: to load text templates.

Twitter Bootstrap: for cleaner styling and changing the nav bar if window width is decreased.

I also took advantage of cookies and the localStorage object to remember the user if the page is reloaded or if the user revisits the page another time.
