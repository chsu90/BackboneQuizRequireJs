BackboneQuizRequireJs
=====================

This quiz app was built with
HTML.
CSS.
Javascript.
jQuery.
Backbone.js.
RequireJS: to define modules and load scripts.
RequireJS text plugin: to load text templates.
Twitter Bootstrap: for cleaner styling and changing the nav bar if on a mobile device or window is resized.

I also took advantage of cookies and the localStorage object to remember the user if the page is reloaded or if the user revisits the page another time.
